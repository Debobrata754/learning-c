For scaning data from file we use:
   int ch or char ch;
   fscanf(pointer, "%d/c/s", &ch);
   or simply use:
     fgetc(pointer);
For writing data in a file we use:
   int ch or char ch;
   fprintf(pointer, "%d/c/s", &ch);
   or simply use:
     fputc('write char what you want to write', pointer);
"r" = open to read.
